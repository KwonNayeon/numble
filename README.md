# Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Closure Prediction Project

## Project Summary

This project focuses on predicting the closure of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) using Business Trends and Outlook Survey Data. Key aspects include:

- **Data Utilization:** Leveraged survey data to analyze and predict SME closures.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implemented models using R, with packages such as `randomForest`, `catboost`, and `BART`.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assessed models with metrics like AUROC, F1 score, and accuracy.
- **Key Findings:** Highlighted the importance of including non-financial data for accurate closure predictions.
