# Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Closure Prediction Project

## Project Summary
- Utilized Business Trends and Outlook Survey Data to predict closures of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
- Implemented machine learning (ML) models using the R language, leveraging packages such as `randomForest`, `catboost`, and `BART`.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as AUROC, F1 score, and accuracy.
- The project findings emphasize the significance of incorporating non-financial data for accurate predictions of small business closures.
